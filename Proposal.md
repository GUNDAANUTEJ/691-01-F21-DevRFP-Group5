# RFP - Bearcat Study Buddy

## Statement of Purpose :

 We intend to build a native web application that would be a solo place where students would be able to track the upcoming assignments, class tasks in an easy way . This tool allows students to even check for updates in the calendar about upcoming to-do lists, memo functionality. This tool will also provide the flexibility for the students to customize the look of the application based on their own choice of themes. The chat option inside the application would ease the communication between students and professors.
 
 
 ## Overview of Project :
 
 We would like to create a native web application in which upon clicking the application we will be re-directed to the screen where it will display two options sign up and sign in. If we have new students who are trying to use this application for the first time, they need to create the profile newly by clicking sign up. Existing students can log in using the sign-in option.

The existing student users can log in with a user id and password, we will include the two-factor authentication with User id and mobile number. For mobile number authentication we will receive a verification code to our mobile after entering the phone number.

Students can view courses they registered for, to-do list, memo functionality which will encourage them to complete a task on time.

We are providing the chat option inside the application so that students can interact with the Professors as well as students.

We are providing additional options for students to customize their own choice of themes according to their choice.

## Benefits :

* This application would provide a single snapshot of calender to check the deadlines of upcoming taks.

* This application would provide a feature with memo functionality option with a little description on the details of the task.
* This application would provide a chat option to students to allow the interaction between students and professors.
* This application will provide user with grid view of courses enrolled.
